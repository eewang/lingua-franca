This program is to help me learn and practice French.

The basic idea is to generate a configurable, random list of verbs, nouns, tenses, etc. for me to practice my French sentence construction and grammar.

The stack is as follows:
Node, Express, Babel, Webpack, React, Redux

On y va!

TODO:
- [ ] Decide on data model
- [ ] Explore translation APIs (Yandex?)
- [ ] Decide on practice strategies - defining a noun, answering a prompt, etc.
- [ ] Mock up basic design - use Sketch?
