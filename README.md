This program is to help me learn and practice French.

The basic idea is to generate a configurable, random list of verbs, nouns, tenses, etc. for me to practice my French sentence construction and grammar.

The stack is as follows:
Node, Express, Babel, Webpack, React, Redux

On y va!

## Getting started

* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run dev`

## How to use

There are a variety of Practice Strategies to learn French. They touch on the various components of comprehension and expression, such as speaking, comprehending, reading, etc. These are the ones that I am going to try and build out, to help me practice French.

And note that while this app is built for French language learning, the principles can be applied to any language.

## Practice strategies
* Answer a question prompt using a set of randomly selected words
* Describe a proper noun in French

## App components / features
* Input new vocabulary - verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.
* Input new question prompts

TODO:
- [x] Decide on data model
- [ ] Explore translation APIs (Yandex?)
- [ ] Decide on practice strategies - defining a noun, answering a prompt, etc.
- [ ] Mock up basic design - use Sketch?
- [ ] Figure out React Router - get Nav rendered across all routes
